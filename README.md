## Lagrangian coherent structures for flows on curved surfaces 
This repository contains MATLAB codes to compute coherent structures and Lagrangian deformation for flows on curved surfaces. Details regarding the method are given in the accompanying paper [S. Santhosh, C. Zhu, B. Fencil, M. Serra](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.23.655805) [1]. The tutorial on how to use this code is described in the [documentation](https://sreejithsanthosh.github.io/FTLEhub/docs/Tutorials/FTLECurvedSurface.html)
